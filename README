Sageify is an open-source instructional material management system. Out of the box, it's rigged to allow the creation of organizations, learners, lessons, and even exams. 

Lessons can be assigned to individual learners, and they can log into the system to view the content. Once they have finished viewing the lesson, a record of their having read the lesson is recorded. 

If a more regimented system is required, you can optionally add exams to the end of a lesson. Assigned learners can take the exam online, and you can check in on their results.

A beta copy of Sageify is hosted at http://sageify.com and organizations can either sign up there for a hosted solution, or download the Rails app and host it themselves.
